# invoicing-api-cs

<hr>

* What I want to achieve here is to build an API for a business invoicing service using C#.<br>However, I intend to make sure that I take my time debugging as we go.<br>
* I feel exhausted already, it seem boring so far. I think I'd just do this with PHP instead, from basic version to a more complex version. I'd start tomorrow. Share as much features as you want me to add on each version. Would write a new version on PHP every week.<br>
* I would start a weekly open-source invoicing API github series with PHP on [Github](https://github.com/1cbyc/invoice-api), create <b>issues</b> with new features you want me to add on every week release.
